2. a. create a constant object and a constant array.

Object => const toy ={ 
    name: "teddy bear",
    color: "brown",
    cloth: "soft",
    manufactedyear: 2024,
};

Array => const arr=[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

2.b. modifying the contents of the object and array 

add the content:

Object => const toy ={ 
    name: "teddy bear",
    color: "brown",
    cloth: "soft",
    manufacturedyear: 2024,
};

toy.bow= "present";
console.log(toy);

output: {name: 'teddy bear', color: 'brown', cloth: 'soft', manufacturedyear: 2024, bow: 'present'}

Array => const arr=[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
arr[6] = 7;
console.log(arr);

output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]

Const variable is a block scope, we cant redeclared or reinitialized the variable but within the block we cant modify the content.
